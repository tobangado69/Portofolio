### About Me

I am a software developer specializing in full-stack JavaScript development, experienced in building both web and mobile applications. I am passionate about creating seamless digital experiences and enjoy transforming complex ideas into intuitive, functional interfaces.

#### My Career Journey

I started my professional career as a technician at Telkom Indonesia, one of the country's largest telecommunications companies. This role helped me develop strong communication skills, a customer-oriented mindset, and the ability to collaborate in dynamic environments.

After graduating from the Hacktiv8 bootcamp, I further strengthened my programming fundamentals through the Bearmentor bootcamp. This transition marked my entry into software development, allowing me to grow both technically and professionally. My training enhanced my problem-solving skills and provided a solid foundation for building modern, scalable applications.

I am dedicated and adaptable, always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you would like to connect or discuss a project, feel free to reach out!
